## Day 3: July 08, 2018
**Today's Progress**
Be familiar with Tensorflow Dataset. Learn how the way they work, how to build data pipline. Such as from CSV file.

**Thoughts**
This is really great update of Tensorflow since Tensorflow Queue.

## Day 4: July 09, 2018
**Today's Progress**
Trend, Chart-Histogram, Mean, Median, Mode, Variance-Standart Deviation, Z-Score

**Thoughts**
Coming back a little bit to Statistic. I'm reading "Head first to Statistic". I was reading it in the past, but I want to finish it completely and take notes some important to sharing as well.
