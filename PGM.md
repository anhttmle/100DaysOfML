# PART 1: Introduction:

## 1.1 Motivation:
The **key property** of a **declarative representation** is the **separation** of _knowledge_ and _reasoning_. The representation has its own clear semantics, _separate_ from _the algorithms_ that one can apply to it. Thus, we can develop a general suite of algorithms that apply any model within a broad class, whether in the domain of medical diagnosis or speech recognition.  Conversely, we **can improve** our **model** for a specific application domain **without** having to **modify** our **reasoning algorithms** _constantly_.
