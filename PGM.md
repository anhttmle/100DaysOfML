# PART 1: Introduction:

## 1.1 Motivation:
- The **key property** of a **declarative representation** is the **separation** of _knowledge_ and _reasoning_. The representation has its own clear semantics, _separate_ from _the algorithms_ that one can apply to it. Thus, we can develop a general suite of algorithms that apply any model within a broad class, whether in the domain of medical diagnosis or speech recognition.  Conversely, we **can improve** our **model** for a specific application domain **without** having to **modify** our **reasoning algorithms** _constantly_.

- Thus, to obtain meaningful conclusions, we need to **reason** not just about what is **possible**, but also about what is **probable**.

- Furthermore, one finds that probabilistic models are very liberating. Where in a more rigid formalism we might find it necessary to enumerate every possibility, here we can often sweep a multitude of annoying exceptions and special cases under the “probabilistic rug,” by introducing outcomes that roughly correspond to “something unusual happens.”
