# Strategy Note

## Software 2.0 work for human: 
- Labeling data
- Maintaining dataset infrastructure:
-   Visualize dataset
-   Create/Edit label
-   Bubble up likely misslabeled examples
-   Suggest data to label
-   Flag labeler disagreements
-   ...

## Challenge on labeling data:
- Data labeling is highly non-trivial
- Chasing Label/Data Imbalances is non-trivial
- Labeling is an iterative process
- Annotation Support:
-   Annotation UI
-   Escalation features
-   Agreement checking
-   Performance tests (model or labeler ?)
-   AI-assisted labeling

## Challenge on 2.0 stack:
- The toolchain for 2.0 stack does not yet exist
-
